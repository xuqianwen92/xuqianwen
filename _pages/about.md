I received the B.Sc. degree from Tianjin University, China in 2014 majoring in Electrical Engineering. Then I obtained the PhD degree from School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in 2018, supervied by Prof. [Wang Peng](https://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=epwang&CategoryDescription=Energy)  and Prof. [Wen Changyun](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ecywen/). After that, I have worked as a research associate in Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong with Prof. [Xu Zhao](http://www.ee.polyu.edu.hk/en/people_detail.php?name=XUZhao&cid=1&id=73) and a postdoc research fellow in Aalborg University, Denmark with Prof. [Frede Blaabjerg](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z6F1QaoAAAAJ&hl=en) respectively. I also visited Imperial College London with Prof. [Tim Green](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.green) during March 2020-June 2020. Currently, I am a Wallenberg-NTU Presidential Postdoc Fellow in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore with Prof. [Xie Lihua](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/elhxie/).

My research interests include control, stability, reliability and optimization of microgrids and smart grids. In this area, I published 14 top-tier journal papers on IEEE transactions as the first author.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
